## Inspiration

According to the statistics of the WHO, an estimated **800,000** people commit suicide per year, which is one person every 40 seconds. Suicide happens to be the second leading cause of death among 15-29 year olds. Suicidal thoughts are generally caused by mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, bi polar disorder and schizophrenia. While some may have the capability of dealing with these problems on their own, a lot of people find it very difficult to lead a normal life with mental illnesses hindering their day today life style. The biggest reason why mental illnesses lead to suicidal thoughts is people's reluctance to convey what they feel to another person.

A motivational chat-bot provides the ideal solution to this problem, since it allows people to discuss their issues anonymously. Considering the fact that young people are greatly affected by mental health issues, a technological solution might be the best approach to deal with the issue. **Suicide Prevention & Motivational Life Companion** of [Project Yalk](https://yalk.io) is the best friend for anyone who wishes to anonymously discuss his/her problems with someone, and requires motivational support.

## What it does

**Project Yalk** is a **non profit organisation** formed to help people with mental health problems. **Yalk** chat-bot provides motivation for people who are going through difficult periods in life. Please note that **Project Yalk** is still in `beta version` and it is still learning how best to provide support for people with mental health issues. Currently the chat-bot is running with limited functionalities and responding only for limited queries.

There are three ways to communicate with **Yalk**. One is through our [website](https://yalk.io) or else you can use messenger in [Project Yalk Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/Project-Yalk-306537050120889). Third way is to use our [Alexa skill](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GW88SRY).

## What's next for Project Yalk

**Yalk** chat-bot needs to be extensively trained to provide the ideal guidance and support for people with mental illnesses. The functionalities of the chat-bot are required to be further improved to respond to the many complex queries by the users effectively.

Furthermore, we are planning to remove Facebook messenger integration from our website to provide more anonymous user experience in future. Our vision is to provide more accurate mentoring and guidance to minimize suicide attempts in people with mental health issues.
